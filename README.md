Personalized SMS Marketing Automation

This repository contains a project focused on automating personalized SMS marketing using TextNow for business clients using Python and Generative AI. The goal is to enhance customer engagement and retention through targeted and automated messaging.

Project Overview: Automated SMS Retention Program for Safe 2 Drive Driving School

Safe 2 Drive Driving School identified a significant drop-off in students who, after obtaining their G2 licenses, do not return to pursue their G licenses. Recognizing the potential to double their profits by retaining these students, Safe 2 Drive needed an effective marketing retention strategy.

Problem Analysis:

Students are eligible to take their G test 12 months after obtaining their G2 license. However, many do not return to the driving school, resulting in lost revenue opportunities. To address this, I developed an automated SMS program designed to re-engage students and encourage them to return for their G test.

Solution: Automated SMS Retention Program

The program is designed to message students 10 months after they receive their G2 license, reminding them that they can begin preparing for their G test with their previous instructor. To incentivize their return, the message includes a 5% discount on lessons. This approach aims to promote retention and foster long-term relationships with students.

This SMS retention program is versatile and can be adapted for various other businesses. For instance, barbershops can use a similar system to check up on clients every two weeks, encouraging regular visits and fostering customer loyalty.
